wordpress-q-crm
===============

a CRM I made in wordpress, needs a bit of an overhaul but works for version iteration 1

As a first version its a case of uploading to your plugins folder and activating.

It installs an extra table and you have ability to:
CRUD per user
Export as CSV all users
Email each user


As far as MVP goes this is what I thought would be appropriate to get this going as a start point.

Any issues or ideas please go nuts or let me know.

thanks
Paul Quinn
